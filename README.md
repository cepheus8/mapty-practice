# MAPTY PROJECT

### ABOUT

This is a simple web application for tracking running and cycling workouts on map developed purely based on vanilla JavaScript.

The project was created as part of udemy course: "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann.

### Features

The project was created during course, although I added two features to the final code:

- deleting workouts
- editing workouts
