# MAPTY PROJECT

### About

This is a simple web application for tracking running and cycling workouts on map developed purely based on vanilla JavaScript.

Mark location of the workout(running or cycling) on the map and add distance, duration, cadence/elevation gain parameters. The app will automatically calculate your average pace/speed.

The project was created as part of udemy course: "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann.

### Features

The project was created during course, although I added two features to the final code:

- **deleting workouts**,

- **editing workouts**.
